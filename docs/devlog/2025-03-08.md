## Functionality

- [ ] Connect to whisper API and display text
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut for copying and inserting at cursor
- [ ] Handle microphone permissions properly
- [ ] Different "modes" - post processing for OpenAI

## UI flair

- [ ] The waveform should "expand out", similar to MIUI's voice recorder app

## Research

How should the recording UI look like?
It should appear in a way that looks native to Arc browser.

## Notes

Rounded linecap.

When the line width is too short, we can't render the rounded linecap properly with
enough fidelity.

To fix this, we can just ignore the linecap entirely.

### Cleanup

Thought I was going crazy with the timecode of the events.
Upon a second recording, there is an offset in the waveform
which is equal to the time since the start of the first
recording (when it should be relative to the newest recording).

At first I thought it might have something to do with
`event.timecode` not being reset when a new recording starts.

The evidence for this was MDN docs, which says:

> Note that the timecode in the first produced BlobEvent does not need to be zero.

However, even when I change to capture the timecode of the
first chunk, I was still getting the offset issue in the waveform.

I eventually realised that the timecode in the `WhispPanelApp` was not being reset.

I tried setting the timecode to `null` after calling
`stopRecording`, but the issue is that the `setTimecode(null)`
runs before the `onstop` event is fired.

This was proven when I ran `console.log` statements, which
showed that there is a `setTimecode(1600)` call after the
`setTimecode(null)` call.

The solution to this was to reset the timecode in the
`onRecordingComplete` callback, instead of in the click
event handler.

I will leave the capturing of the first timecode in the
`use-audio-recorder` hook, because it still handles the
first timecode not being zero properly.

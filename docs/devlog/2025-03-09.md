## Functionality

- [x] Keyboard shortcut for copying and inserting at cursor

## Notes

### Microphone permissions

Each time you try to run the extension, it requires access to the microphone
on that tab's domain.

This is because the content script is loaded on that page.

This is annoying because it means we have to grant microphone permissions
everytime we want to run the extension on a new website.

Attempting to run the recording in the `background.ts` background script
doesn't work because there the `navigate.mediaDevices` object is undefined.

There is 1 possible workaround that I found on StackOverflow:

Have a persistent content script that injects an iframe into the page to
load the UI. As seen in [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50991321/chrome-extension-getusermedia-throws-notallowederror-failed-due-to-shutdown).

WXT does have an `<iframe>` [UI injection mode](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/content-scripts.html#iframe),
and that is probably what I will try next.

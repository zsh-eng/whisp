## Functionality

- [x] Automatically fill in the textarea and then submit the prompt for
      OpenAI, DeepSeek, Claude, and Perplexity.

I want to reduce the number of clicks required for me to send a prompt.

- [x] Add a "voice input" button in the bottom right for selected sites.

I think this is enough for now, I'll just keep dogfooding the extension locally.

- [ ] Different "modes" - post processing for OpenAI

## UI flair

- [ ] The waveform should "expand out", similar to MIUI's voice recorder app
- [ ] Custom UI for each of the chat websites, making it seem native to that partcular site.

## Research

- [ ] MCP Server and Client

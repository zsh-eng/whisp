I suddenly thought of the killer feature that would make this
*incredibly* useful for my own personal usecase:

**Interleaving voice and text.**

Since OpenAI's whisper model can return the transcription in srt format,
I can just say something, paste text, then say something else
(and so on).
When I'm done, it can construct a single prompt with the interleaving
of my voice and pasted text and I can just copy and hit send.

This is really useful for me as I have a tendency to write my prompts in the
following format:

1. Explain the context of the pasted text.
2. Paste the text - e.g. a code snippet, homework answer or essay paragraph.
3. Ask a clarifying question.

Here's roughly what the interleaved text might look like:

```txt
The following is part of my essay on the topic of...
Here's the rough outline of what I wanted to write.

<pasted-text>
...
</pasted-text>

I think my rough idea makes sense, but could do with some improvements
along the lines of...

For your reference, here's the asisgnment instructions for the essay:

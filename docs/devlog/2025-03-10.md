I suddenly thought of the killer feature that would make this
*incredibly* useful for my own personal usecase:

**Interleaving voice and text.**

Since OpenAI's whisper model can return the transcription in srt format,
I can just say something, paste text, then say something else
(and so on).
When I'm done, it can construct a single prompt with the interleaving
of my voice and pasted text and I can just copy and hit send.

This is really useful for me as I have a tendency to write my prompts in the
following format:

1. Explain the context of the pasted text.
2. Paste the text - e.g. a code snippet, homework answer or essay paragraph.
3. Ask a clarifying question.

Here's roughly what the interleaved text might look like:

```txt
The following is part of my essay on the topic of...
Here's the rough outline of what I wanted to write.

<pasted-text>
...
</pasted-text>

I think my rough idea makes sense, but could do with some improvements
along the lines of...

For your reference, here's the asisgnment instructions for the essay:

</pasted-text>

## Cleanup

- [x] Refactor of components and general cleanup

## Microphone Permissions Investigation

I attempted to use a full sized iframe or the UI instead,
but the problem with that is you can't have the iframe be `pointer-events: none`
while having the elements inside be clickable.

See this [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23329991/how-can-you-make-an-iframe-have-pointer-events-none-but-not-on-a-div-inside-th)
discussion for more information.

At this point, the only solution that I can think of might involve
opening another extension page / extension popup to handle the microphone
input.

I want to avoid this, and it's also an unnecessary complication.
For now, I think it's acceptable to just have to grant the microphone permission
every time
(I'm only using it on websites like Google, ChatGPT, Claude, etc. anyway).

I think the iframe approach is still possible, but it would require
setting the styling of the iframe to be the precise size of the content
that you want to display.

## Functionality

- [ ] Different "modes" - post processing for OpenAI

## UI flair

- [ ] The waveform should "expand out", similar to MIUI's voice recorder app

## Research

- [ ] MCP Server and Client
